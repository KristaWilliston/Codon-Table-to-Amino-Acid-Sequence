# Codon-Table-to-Amino-Acid-Sequence

This program takes a codon table file (standard.code) and a file containing nucleotide sequence (anthrax_sasp.nuc) as command-line arguments, and outputs the amino-acid sequence.
The program will indicate whether or not the initial codon is consistent with the codon table's start codons.
NCBI's taxonomy resource can be used to look up and download the correct codon table for the anthrax bacterium. Re-run the program using the correct codon tab.
